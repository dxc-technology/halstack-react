        Icons are visual elements that can serve different purposes depending on their context. In Halstack, icons are
        used not only to <strong>represent ideas, objects, or actions</strong>, but also to support the user's journey
        through the interface. They <strong>help guide attention</strong>, reinforce meaning, and visually enhance
        actions or sections within an application.

              At Halstack, we've chosen to adopt the Material Icons library, specifically the <strong>outline</strong>{" "}
              and <strong>filled</strong> variants, as our standard icon set. While we did not create these icons
              ourselves, there are strong reasons behind this decision that align with the goals of our design system:
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcBulletedList>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Consistency</strong>: Material Icons offer a comprehensive, visually coherent set of icons that
                cover a wide range of common actions, objects, and concepts. Using a unified library helps us maintain
                consistency across all Halstack-based products.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Scalability</strong>: with hundreds of pre-designed icons available and frequent updates,
                Material Icons scale easily with product needs: whether we're designing simple interfaces or more
                complex workflows.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Accessibility</strong>: Material Icons are built with accessibility in mind, supporting clear
                recognition and compatibility with assistive technologies when used correctly.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Design and engineering efficiency</strong>: leveraging a widely adopted icon set reduces the
                effort needed to create and maintain custom icons. This speeds up both design and development workflows,
                allowing teams to focus on building better user experiences.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Cross-platform support</strong>: Material Icons are optimized for use across web, Android, and
                iOS platforms, helping us build consistent and adaptable experiences regardless of the target platform.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            </DxcBulletedList>
            <DxcParagraph>
              By adopting Material Icons, we ensure that our iconography remains modern, flexible, and easy to work
              with, without sacrificing quality or usability.

          Material Icons are grouped into <strong>functional categories</strong> that help organize their purpose and

          icon for each context.

          Halstack supports two visual styles of Material Icons: <strong>Outline</strong> and <strong>Filled</strong>.
          Both styles are available through the Material Icons library and can be used across the design system
          depending on the context and visual intent. By offering both outline and filled styles, Halstack ensures
          visual flexibility while maintaining system consistency. Designers can use tone and emphasis intentionally,
          matching icon style to context without compromising clarity or usability.

            <DxcParagraph>
              The <strong>outline</strong> icons are characterized by their lightweight, hollow appearance with thin
              strokes and open shapes. They offer a modern, minimalist aesthetic that aligns well with Halstack's clean
              UI philosophy.

              <strong>Filled</strong> icons feature solid shapes with strong visual presence. This style creates a sense
              of emphasis and weight, making it suitable for highlighting actions or reinforcing key statuses in the UI.
            </DxcParagraph>

              While not the default in Halstack, filled icons are available for <strong>intentional use cases</strong>{" "}

            <DxcParagraph>Filled icons are effective when:</DxcParagraph>

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                Reinforcing <strong>status and feedback</strong>, especially in system messages (e.g., error, success,

              </DxcBulletedList.Item>

            </DxcBulletedList>
            <DxcParagraph>
              However, because of their bolder visual weight, filled icons should be used carefully to avoid visual

              example. Therefore, this custom icon introduces a visual “noise” that could potentially break the
              consistency of the interface. While it may be visually appealing on its own, this custom icon feels out of

            <strong>Handling icons in frames</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Material Icons are carefully designed and optimized within a <strong>24×24 pixel frame</strong>. This
              frame includes built-in padding and alignment rules that ensure the icon scales correctly and aligns
              visually with text and components.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcParagraph>
              <strong>Avoid resizing or cropping the icon inside its original frame</strong>. Doing so may lead to
              misalignment, uneven spacing, or loss of visual balance.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <Figure caption="Material icons with grid and safe area">
              <Image src={iconsGrid} alt="Material icons with grid and safe area" />

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Keep the default icon names</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Each Material Icon comes with a predefined name (e.g., <Code>edit</Code>, <Code>check_circle</Code>,{" "}
              <Code>menu</Code>). We <strong>recommend keeping this name unchanged</strong> when importing or using the
              icon in Figma or code, as it makes collaboration between design and development easier and it aligns with
              the original documentation and Material search.

            <strong>Use consistent sizes</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>Halstack commonly uses icons at these sizes:</DxcParagraph>
            <DxcBulletedList type="circle">
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>16x16 px</strong> - for compact UI elements (e.g., small buttons, tags)
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>20x20 px</strong> - for medium-sized interactions

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>

            </DxcBulletedList>
            <DxcParagraph>
              These sizes map directly to our <strong>height tokens</strong>. Other sizes from the height scale are
              acceptable, but use them <strong>only when necessary</strong>, such as in hero banners or extra-large
              action areas.

            <strong>Respect spacing and alignment</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Icons should align vertically centered with adjacent text or content, maintain consistent padding when
              placed inside components (e.g., icon + label buttons), and never be stretched or highly cropped. Follow
              spacing tokens for margins and paddings. When paired with text, use a spacing token between the icon and
              label to ensure visual balance.
            </DxcParagraph>
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Choose the right style: outline vs filled</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Use <strong>outline</strong> icons as the <strong>default</strong> style in Halstack. They are clean,
              lightweight, and match the overall tone of our UI. When needing additional visual emphasis, use filled
              icons for active or selected states, important status indicators, or in places with low visual density or
              dark background.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Avoid mixing outline and filled styles in the same context unless you are using them to clearly indicate{" "}
              <strong>states</strong> or <strong>semantic differences</strong>.
            </DxcParagraph>
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Don't use icons without clear purpose</strong>
            <DxcParagraph>
              Every icon should add value and support comprehension. Avoid using icons just for decoration: if it
              doesn't clarify, reinforce, or simplify an interaction, it's better to leave it out. Also avoid overly
              abstract or ambiguous icons. Clarity is more important than cleverness.
