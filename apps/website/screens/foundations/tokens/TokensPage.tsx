          Design tokens are the <strong>single source of truth</strong> for all design decisions in the Halstack Design
          System. They create a shared language between design and development, ensuring consistency across products
          while maintaining flexibility where customization is needed.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          In Halstack, tokens define core attributes like <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>typography</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>spacing</strong>, and more—serving as the foundation for scalable, themeable, and reusable component
          styling.

          Tokens allow product teams to build faster, with greater consistency and confidence.

          When Halstack was first established, its token structure followed a two-tier model:{" "}
          <strong>primitive tokens</strong> (the raw foundational values) and <strong>component tokens</strong> (styles
          appliedWIP at the component level.) The intermediate <strong>alias layer</strong>—commonly used to connect
          foundations to components—was missing.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          Over time, this gap led to inconsistencies. Each component seemed to "speak its own language," with naming
          conventions, color assignments, and styling logic varying wildly between them. Without clear documentation or
          a shared taxonomy, this structure is hard to maintain and harder to scale.

              The absence of a middle layer and a consistent naming strategy cause several challenges:

                <strong>Inconsistent styles</strong>: Components with similar behaviors (e.g., hover states) often used
                unrelated token values.

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>

              At this stage, the <strong>Core</strong> and <strong>Alias</strong> layers are already in place and
              actively used in both design and development workflows. These two layers give us a solid foundation of
              structured, semantic tokens that ensure consistency and scalability.

              The next step is to extend this work into the <strong>Component layer</strong>, where tokens will be
              defined specifically for UI components by referencing existing Alias tokens. This will allow us to
              standardize pattern across all Halstack components and give product teams even greater flexibility when
              theming. <u>We expect to begin working on this layer in the coming months.</u>

              By separating raw values from their semantic role, we not only enable easy theming and quick adjustments
              without touching the foundational values, but also establish clear <strong>usage expectations</strong>:
              whether a token should be applied as a <strong>background (bg)</strong>, <strong>foreground (fg)</strong>,
              or <strong>border</strong> element. This reduces ambiguity and ensures that tokens are applied

        <DxcParagraph>
          Until now, Halstack has supported <strong>two theming strategies</strong>—an{" "}
          <strong>opinionated approach</strong> with limited, safe customization, and an{" "}
          <strong>advanced approach</strong> with broader freedom. Several products have already benefited from these
          strategies.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          With the new token architecture, our goal is to <strong>continue supporting both levels of theming</strong>,{" "}
          even though the underlying structure that makes them possible will change. This ensures that product teams can
          rely on the same flexibility they know today, while also benefiting from a more scalable and consistent
          system.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          By aligning this strategy with our <strong>token architecture</strong>:
          <DxcBulletedList>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              With the <strong>Core layer</strong>, we can already enable <strong>opinionated theming</strong>, exposing
              tokens like colors, spacing, or typography in a way that is safe and predictable.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              To unlock <strong>Advanced theming</strong>, we will rely on the upcoming <strong>Component layer</strong>
              , which will allow deeper overrides at the component-token level. This work is still in progress and will
              be rolled out in the coming months.

          This structured approach ensures that theming in Halstack is <strong>flexible but safe</strong>—giving teams
          the ability to adapt components to their needs while still protecting those{" "}
          <strong>design decisions that are critical for accessibility</strong> such as maintaining proper{" "}
