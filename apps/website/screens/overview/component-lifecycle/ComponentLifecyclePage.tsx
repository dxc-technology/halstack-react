          The lifecycle of a component within a Design System comprises several stages, spanning from its creation to
          eventual retirement. Starting with the design and development phases, components are conceptualized, designed
          and implemented. Once in use, they undergo real-world testing and user feedback to identify usability issues
          and potential improvements. As the system progresses, components may be upgraded or even withdrawn to meet
          ever-evolving standards and user requirements.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          Each of the states can be understood as milestones that summarize the maturity lifecycle of the components in
          Halstack and have their implications or requirements which need to be fulfilled to move from one to another.
          This process is non-linear, which means that a component can go backwards if the situation requires so.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          Adhering to this lifecycle ensures that our designers and developers uphold a well-organized Design System,
          facilitating a smooth and intuitive user experience.

          The component is ready for preliminary usage. It meets most maturity criteria, and use is encouraged for most
          scenarios. It may undergo last minute changes from its first uses, unexpected scenarios and actual user
          experience, which can sometimes be hard to estimate.
