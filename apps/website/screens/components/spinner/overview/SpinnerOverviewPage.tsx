        The spinner component is a visual indicator that communicates to users that a process is in progress. It is
        commonly used for loading states, where content or data retrieval takes time, indicating that an action is being
        executed. Spinners help maintain a smooth user experience by reducing uncertainty and providing feedback while
        waiting. They can be adapted in size and color to fit different contexts, making them a versatile choice for
        various loading scenarios.

            <strong>Use spinners for real-time feedback:</strong> implement the spinner only when there is a delay in
            content loading or an ongoing process that requires user awareness. Avoid unnecessary use that may lead to
            confusion.

                <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                  The <strong>default (large) spinner</strong> is ideal for full-page or major loading states that
                  require user attention.
                </DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                  The <strong>overlay spinner</strong> works well for modal or section-based loading, preventing
                  interaction with specific content while keeping the rest of the UI accessible.
                </DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                  The <strong>small spinner</strong> is best for inline feedback, such as button actions, table updates,
                  or background data processing.
                </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              </DxcBulletedList>

          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Prevent indefinite loading states:</strong> always ensure the spinner disappears once the process is
            complete. If an operation takes too long, consider displaying a message or progress indicator with more
            details.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Avoid blocking critical interactions:</strong> if possible, allow users to navigate or interact with
            other elements while waiting. Overlay spinners should be used cautiously to prevent unnecessary disruption.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Combine with descriptive labels when necessary:</strong> if the loading state might be unclear,
            include a short label (e.g., "Loading data…" or "Processing request…") to provide context.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Optimize performance:</strong> if an operation takes longer than expected, consider showing an
            estimated time or an alternative UI state to maintain user engagement.
