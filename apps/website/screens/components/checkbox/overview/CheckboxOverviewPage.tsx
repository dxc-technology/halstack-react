          Checkboxes support different states, including checked, unchecked, and indeterminate, providing clear visual
          feedback. Checkboxes <strong>should be used when multiple selections are needed</strong>, unlike radio
          buttons, which are for single-choice scenarios. Proper spacing and alignment help maintain clarity, and labels
          should be concise and descriptive to enhance usability.

              To <strong>improve readability and scalability</strong>, checkboxes can be stacked vertically, especially
              in forms or settings panels, allowing users to process options more efficiently without excessive eye
              movement.

              Used in scenarios with limited vertical space, checkboxes can be stacked horizontally, along with a
              consistent spacing and alignment, to maintain a structured and organized layout. If a set of checkboxes is
              related to a single category, consider using a group label to provide context as this will enhance
              usability and help users make informed selections.

          By default, the label is placed <strong>to the left of the checkbox</strong>, but it can also be positioned{" "}
          <strong>to the right</strong> when needed. Choose the label position that best fits your layout and ensures
          clear readability and alignment with surrounding elements.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          We recommend selecting a label placement that maintains a strong visual connection between the checkbox and
          its description, without disrupting the overall flow of the interface.

                Use when users can select <strong>multiple options</strong> independently. Each checkbox represents an
                on/off decision, making them suitable for filters, preference settings, or multi-select tasks. A group
                may allow none, some, or all options to be selected.

                Use when the user must select <strong>only one option</strong> from a list of predefined, mutually
                exclusive choices. Ideal for short, static lists where all options should be visible at once to support
                decision-making.

                Use for a <strong>single, immediate toggle</strong> between two states, like on/off or enabled/disabled.
                Switches should act instantly and are best for system or UI-level settings.

            <strong>Use for multiple selections:</strong> checkboxes should be used when users can select multiple
            options independently. If only one selection is allowed, use radio buttons instead.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Ensure clear labels:</strong> each checkbox should have a clear, concise label that accurately
            describes the option. Avoid ambiguous wording that might confuse users.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Group related options:</strong> when checkboxes are part of a related set, use a group label to
            provide context. This improves readability and helps users understand the available choices.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Prioritize vertical stacking:</strong> for better readability and usability, stack checkboxes
            vertically, especially when dealing with multiple options. Horizontal stacking should be reserved for short
            lists with clear, non-wrapping labels.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Use the indeterminate state properly:</strong> the indeterminate state should only be used when a
            parent checkbox controls multiple sub-options. This visually indicates that some but not all child options
            are selected.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Maintain sufficient spacing:</strong> provide adequate spacing between checkboxes to prevent
            misclicks and ensure a clean, organized layout.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Ensure accessibility:</strong> make checkboxes large enough to be easily clickable and ensure they
            are keyboard-navigable. Labels should be linked correctly for screen readers to interpret them properly.
