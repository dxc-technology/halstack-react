        Chips are versatile components that allow users to display and manage information in a compact format. They are
        commonly used to represent selected options, tags, filters, or interactive elements within an interface. Their
        lightweight and flexible design makes them ideal for enhancing user experience by enabling quick and organized
        interactions.

              Chips are commonly used to organize content by grouping related topics, products, or subjects. They often
              serve as a summary of the page's content. When using chips for categorization, ensure that they are
              relevant to the displayed information to maintain clarity and usability.

            <DxcParagraph>
              When used alongside the select component, chips serve as effective filter facets, allowing users to refine
              search results by choosing and removing specific attributes. This combination enables users to include or
              exclude preferences directly from their queries. For faceted filtering, chips should be dismissible,
              ensuring effortless adjustments and a more intuitive selection experience.

                    Chips help users categorize, filter, or organize information. They often include keywords or
                    metadata, providing quick access to related content and aiding navigation.

              While the component configuration is flexible enough to allow multiple icons or action icons, it is{" "}
              <strong>not recommended</strong> to use two icons or two action icons within the same chip. Instead, a{" "}
              <strong>balanced approach</strong> should be followed: pairing one <strong>icon</strong> (to provide

                Ensure that icons are <strong>easy to recognize and understand</strong> within the chip's context. The
                selected icon should accurately represent the chip's purpose, while the action icon should clearly
                indicate the interaction it triggers.

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                Icons <strong>should not compete for attention</strong> or convey conflicting messages. Instead, they
                should complement each other to enhance usability.

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
