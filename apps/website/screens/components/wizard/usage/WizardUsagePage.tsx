          There could be some scenarios in which the content of a step wants to be validated while the user is filling
          the fields with information or doing relevant actions in every step of the wizard. For that case, a validation
          mark can be represented in every step once the user navigate to the next step in the linear progression. This
          will represent the status of the validation respecting the content, with a success mark or an error mark
          visible on the step mark.

        <Example example={validation} />
