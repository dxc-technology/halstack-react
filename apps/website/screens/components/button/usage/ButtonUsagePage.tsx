          Any icon can be used in Halstack Design System, so it is up to the user to choose which one suits its use case
          better. But, it is recommended to use the same library of icons throughout the application to keep
          consistency.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Do not use icons mainly for visual interest, the glyph must add information and clarification to the action
            that would be performed in the context of the button.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            A button with an icon and no text is also allowed in the design system. In such a situation and in order to
            preserve the accessibility of the button, the use of the <Code>title</Code> prop is mandatory.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The <Code>title</Code> prop offers a contextual bubble with missing information necessary to clarify the
            action performed by the button. It also provides an accessible gateway when no regular label can be
            specified.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>

          The context in which a button is used often dictates its size. Halstack provides buttons in different sizes to
          help create interfaces that are not only functional but also intuitive and accessible, catering to a wide
          range of user needs and interaction scenarios.

        <DxcParagraph>
          Varying button sizes help establish a clear visual hierarchy, guiding users towards the most critical actions.
          Primary actions are made more prominent with larger buttons, while secondary actions use smaller buttons to
          avoid distraction.
