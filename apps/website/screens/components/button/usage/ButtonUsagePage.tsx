        <DxcParagraph>
          Any icon can be used in Halstack Design System, so it is up to the user to choose which one suits its use case
          better. But, it is recommended to use the same library of icons throughout the application to keep
          consistency.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcBulletedList>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The icon can go before or after the text with a separation of 8 pixels respecting the main button's text.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Do not use icons mainly for visual interest, the glyph must add information and clarification to the action
            that would be performed in the context of the button.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            A button with an icon and no text is also allowed in the design system. In such a situation and in order to
            preserve the accessibility of the button, the use of the <Code>title</Code> prop is mandatory.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The <Code>title</Code> prop offers a contextual bubble with missing information necessary to clarify the
            action performed by the button. It also provides an accessible gateway when no regular label can be
            specified.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Try to limit the use of icon-only buttons. Whenever possible, the icon should be accompanied by a label.
