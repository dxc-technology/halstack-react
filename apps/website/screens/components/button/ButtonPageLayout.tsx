            Buttons are basic interface elements that initialize an action or function when the user interacts with
            them. The appearance of the button should suggest the user takes an action that leads to different
            scenarios. These elements that reinforce to the user the necessity to interact are called CTA (Call to
            Action) components, which basically are designed to capture user attention and improve the user experience
            within the application.
