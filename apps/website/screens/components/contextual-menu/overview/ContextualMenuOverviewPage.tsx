        This powerful component improves user experience by allowing users to{" "}
        <strong>navigate through page-level content</strong> or choose from a list of actions while complementing the
        general disposition of the main content within the interface. It also allows a wide range of possibilities when
        it comes to placing content cohesively and comprehensively. To achieve this, it's important to understand how
        the items in our contextual menu behave and interact with each other.

          Although visually similar, the Sidenav component and the contextual menu differ significantly in
          functionality. Our Sidenav is designed to provide a consistent and persistent navigation structure throughout
          the application, allowing users to easily switch between different sections or pages within the app.

          On the other hand, the contextual menu is more{" "}
          <strong>context-sensitive, and appears in response to specific user actions</strong>, offering a set of
          relevant options or actions that can be performed on the current page. This means that it{" "}
          <strong>operates on a page level</strong>, so the component may appear or not depending on the specific needs
          and requirements for each screen or interaction.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Align properly:</strong> position the contextual menu to the left or right, avoiding placement in
            the center to prevent obstruction of main content.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Use badges for status indication:</strong> incorporate a Badge component to display status updates,

            <strong>Default selection:</strong> when pre-selecting an option, try to limit it to the first menu item to

            <strong>Avoid deep hierarchies:</strong> limit navigation depth to a maximum of three levels to prevent
            excessive indentation and complexity.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Restrict icon usage:</strong> use icons only at the first navigation level to maintain readability

            usability. Keep them purposeful and minimal.
