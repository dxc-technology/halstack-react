        Tabs are interactive UI components that allow users to navigate between different sections of content within the
        same page. They help organize related information efficiently, improving usability by reducing clutter and
        enabling seamless content switching. Tabs are commonly used in dashboards, settings panels, and content-heavy
        applications to enhance user experience.

        Tabs are an effective way to organize content within a user interface by keeping related sections grouped
        together while minimizing clutter. They improve usability by allowing users to quickly switch between different
        views without navigating away from the page. When designed and implemented correctly, tabs enhance the user
        experience by making content more accessible and easier to interact with.

                  There are two types of tabs: <strong>Default</strong> and <strong>Container</strong>. Both types share
                  the same hierarchy and should never be nested within each other. Tabs are typically positioned above
                  the content, under the header or general navigation.

          <strong>Maintain logical order:</strong> arrange tabs in a meaningful sequence based on user needs and place
          frequently used or primary tabs first.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Keep tab labels short & clear:</strong> use concise, descriptive labels (1-2 words) that clearly
          indicate the content. Avoid using generic or ambiguous labels like "Info" or "More." Instead, choose specific
          terms that reflect the content, such as "Account Details" for user-related settings or "Billing" for payment
          information and prioritize readabilityâ€”avoid using all caps unless necessary.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Managing the number of tabs effectively:</strong> while not a strict rule, keeping the number of tabs
          manageable (ideally 5-7) helps maintain clarity and usability. If additional tabs are necessary, assess the
          information architecture carefully and consider grouping related items.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use icons thoughtfully:</strong> ensure the icon is intuitive and clearly represents the content of
          the tab. While they are generally used alongside labels, they can also be used independently. In such cases,
          it is crucial to choose highly recognizable icons that clearly convey meaning without additional text. When
          used together, the icon and label must work harmoniously to reinforce their meaning and avoid any conflicting
          interpretations. Avoid using overly decorative or generic icons that do not provide clear meaning, such as an
          abstract shape with no context.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Keep design consistent:</strong> while the component is flexible enough to support a mix of label-only
          and label-with-icon tabs, it's best to choose one style per set. Mixing both can reduce scannability and
          create visual imbalance, impacting the overall usability.
