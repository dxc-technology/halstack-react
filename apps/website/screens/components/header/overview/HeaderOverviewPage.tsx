        The Header serves as the primary navigation and identity element for an application. It includes branding, quick
        access to key sections via navigation links, and a user account menu. Its consistent presence reinforces brand
        recognition and improves usability by offering easy navigation and access to user-related actions.

            <strong>Container:</strong> a layout structure that wraps all Header elements, ensuring consistent
            alignment, spacing, and maximum width limits. The container helps keep the header properly aligned across
            different screen sizes.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Brand Image:</strong> a clear, balanced logo that fits well within the header without overpowering

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>Application Name</strong> <em>(Optional)</em>: a short, recognizable application name placed next to

            The <strong>default</strong> variant features a clean header without a visual separation from the page
            content, ideal for minimalistic or immersive layouts.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The <strong>underlined</strong> variant includes a subtle bottom divider, creating a clear visual boundary
            between the header and the rest of the page content, enhancing structure and clarity.

          Since applications are accessed from a variety of devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones, it's
          essential to design a Header that adapts fluidly to different screen sizes. The responsive Header should
          maintain the core structure and visual hierarchy of the desktop version, ensuring a consistent and intuitive
          user experience across all devices.

          <strong>Keep the Header minimal and functional:</strong> include only essential elements.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Select the correct variant according to visual needs:</strong> Use the <strong>default</strong>{" "}
          variant for simple pages and underlined variant to visually separate the Header from the content when
          necessary.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use dropdowns correctly for complex navigation:</strong> Only use Header dropdowns when necessary to
          organize multiple links logically without overwhelming the top navigation.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Avoid overcrowding the Header:</strong> Limit the number of top-level navigation links. Group
          secondary links inside dropdowns if needed to maintain a clean and user-friendly interface.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Display the application name clearly and concisely:</strong> The application name should be readable,
          short, and not overpower the brand logo. It reinforces brand identity and provides immediate context to users.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Design the Header to respond gracefully to smaller screens:</strong> When adapting the Header to
          mobile or tablet layouts, restructure the content to preserve both visual clarity and functional hierarchy.
