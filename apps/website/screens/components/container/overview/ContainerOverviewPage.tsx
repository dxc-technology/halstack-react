          The Halstack's container component provides a structured way to manage layout and spacing within the Halstack
          Design System. It allows for controlled use of design tokens such as spacing, borders, and shadows, ensuring
          consistency across the UI.

          Being generic in nature, it can be overused, so it's important to consider situations where more specific and
          expressive components could be used.

          Below, we share a series of essential links to help you understand and use the container component correctly.
          If you are not acquainted with these concepts, we strongly recommend taking a moment to review them:
