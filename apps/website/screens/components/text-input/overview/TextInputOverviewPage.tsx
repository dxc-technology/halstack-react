        Text inputs are essential UI elements that enable users to enter and interact with{" "}
        <strong>text-based information</strong>. They are widely used in forms for collecting data, performing searches,
        and completing various user interactions. Use text inputs to facilitate user input in structured formats such as
        usernames, descriptions, URLs, phone numbers, credit card details, emails, and addresses. Ensuring clear labels,
        proper validation, and intuitive formatting enhances usability and improves the overall user experience.

            searching).

          Form inputs are essential UI elements that allow users to interact with digital products by{" "}

        <DxcParagraph>
          A form input (also known as a form field) is used to capture user data. Common input types include text
          fields, date pickers, number fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, toggles, and dropdowns. Forms should always
          include a submission method, such as a submit button, link, or keyboard trigger, to complete the interaction.

        Text inputs, in particular, are commonly found in forms, search bars, and interactive fields that require text

                  which is particularly useful when large data has been introduced.

                  tailor the input's behavior to their specific use case, enabling more{" "}

              Halstack inputs also support the use of prefixes and suffixes, which are visual elements that help users

              context and improve clarity during data entry.

              The <strong>autosuggest</strong> feature in our text input provides users with{" "}
              <strong>real-time suggestions</strong> as they type, based on a predefined list of options. As the user
              enters characters, the input field dynamically filters and displays matching values in a dropdown,
              allowing for quick and efficient selection.

              This feature is particularly useful for reducing input errors, speeding up data entry, and guiding users
              toward valid or commonly used values, especially in cases where the list of possibilities is large but
              predictable, such as country names, email domains, or product codes. It enhances usability by minimizing
