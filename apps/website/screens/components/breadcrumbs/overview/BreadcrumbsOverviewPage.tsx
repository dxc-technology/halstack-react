        Breadcrumbs are a navigational component used in user interfaces to improve the user experience by providing a{" "}
        <strong>clear path to previous steps or navigational levels</strong>. They typically display the user's current
        location within the hierarchical structure of an application, allowing for easy navigation and improved
        orientation.

          When there are more than four items in the breadcrumbs, the component will{" "}
          <strong>collapse the items in a dropdown menu</strong> to avoid overloading the interface. Users can click on
          the dropdown to view the hidden items and navigate to the desired level.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          Although this can be configurable, we highly encourage our users to stick with the collapsing at five or more
          items. This was not a random decision, we carefully selected it to ensure the component does not overload the
          interface and remains an effective navigational aid.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <Example example={collapsed} />
        <DxcParagraph>
          Depending on the amount of available space, the collapsed <strong>breadcrumbs can be synthesized more</strong>{" "}
          by removing the root element and displaying only the collapsed dropdown and the current page.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <Example example={noRoot} />
        <DxcParagraph>Be mindful of your user's cognitive load and collapse breadcrumbs appropriately.</DxcParagraph>

          Use breadcrumbs to <strong>support secondary navigation in hierarchical structures</strong>, helping users
          understand where they are and how they got there.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          Always include the full path from the homepage or root section to the current page to provide meaningful
          context.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          Display <strong>only one breadcrumb trail per page</strong> to avoid confusion and maintain a clear navigation
          hierarchy.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          Make all breadcrumb items navigable except for the last one, which should reflect the current page and remain
          non-interactive.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Keep labels concise</strong> and consistent with the destination page titles to avoid ambiguity.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Place breadcrumbs at the top of the page</strong>, just below the main navigation or header, to follow
          common UI patterns and user expectations.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          Avoid using breadcrumbs as a replacement for primary navigationâ€”they are meant to complement it, not replace
          menus or sidebars.

        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          When truncating breadcrumbs due to space constraints,{" "}
          <strong>prioritize showing the first and last items</strong> while collapsing the middle items with a clear
          overflow mechanism.
