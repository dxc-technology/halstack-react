        Date inputs allow users to enter or select a specific date using a calendar picker or manual text entry.
        Designed to support a wide range of use cases, from booking systems to form submissions, it ensures clarity and
        consistency in date formats, helps prevent input errors, and adapts to different locale and accessibility
        requirements. Its combination of manual input and guided selection provides flexibility while maintaining a
        streamlined user experience.

            <strong>Label</strong> <em>(Optional)</em>: a descriptive text that helps users understand what information

          Form inputs are essential UI elements that allow users to interact with digital products by{" "}
          <strong>entering or selecting data</strong>. Choosing the right input type and structure is key to designing
          efficient, user-friendly forms that support task completion and data accuracy.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          A form input (also known as a form field) is used to capture user data. Common input types include text
          fields, date pickers, number fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, toggles, and dropdowns. Forms should always
          include a submission method, such as a submit button, link, or keyboard trigger, to complete the interaction.

              <DxcBulletedList.Item>

                <strong>Disabled:</strong> This state prevents users from interacting with the field. It's typically
                used when a value is not applicable or editable under certain conditions or roles.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                <strong>Error:</strong> When a user enters invalid or incomplete data, the input shows an error state,
                often accompanied by a helpful message to guide corrections.

                ideal for fields with auto-calculated values. Unlike disabled fields, read-only inputs can still be
                submitted with the form and are part of the form data.

          Date inputs are designed to help users provide valid, well-formatted dates with minimal friction. Unlike
          standard text fields, <strong>they combine manual input with an interactive date picker</strong>, making them
          ideal for scenarios like bookings, forms, or scheduling events. They are particularly useful for reducing
          input errors and ensuring consistent formatting across different regions and use cases.

              As most of our form inputs, the date input includes a clear (close) icon that allows users to quickly
              remove the selected or typed date with a single click. This is especially helpful when correcting mistakes
              or resetting the field during form completion. The icon is only visible when a value is present, keeping
              the interface clean and focused.

              allows users to <strong>select a date visually from a calendar</strong>, reducing the likelihood of
              formatting errors. The picker includes navigational controls to switch between months and years, ensuring

            Our date input supports internationalization by <strong>adapting to locale-specific formats</strong> (e.g.,
            DD/MM/YYYY vs. MM/DD/YYYY) and calendar language. This ensures that users across different regions
            understand the input format and interact with the component comfortably. It's especially important to align
            the expected format with the user's regional settings or provide format guidance with placeholders and
