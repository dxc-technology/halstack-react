          This component is not a 1-to-1 replacement of the <Code>ul</Code> <Code>ol</Code> native tags. These native
          tags have many different use-cases and the Bulleted List only covers one of them: listing text items within a
          document.

          Lists can be ordered or unordered. If the order of the list items matters for context to the user, an ordered
          list should be used. If the meaning of the list is not changed based on the order of the items, an unordered
          list should be used.
