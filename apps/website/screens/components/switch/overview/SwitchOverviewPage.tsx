        The switch component enables users to <strong>toggle a specific setting on or off</strong>. It is designed for
        binary decisions that directly affect system behavior or user preferences. Unlike checkboxes or radio buttons,
        switches represent immediate state changes — they do not require form submission. They are especially effective
        in settings panels, preferences, and mobile interfaces where quick, inline control is essential.

              The preferred layout for lists of switches. It <strong>enhances readability</strong> and ensures each

          By default, the label is placed <strong>before the switch</strong>, as this position clearly communicates what
          the control is for and improves accessibility. However, it's also possible to position the label{" "}
          <strong>after the switch</strong> in specific cases — particularly when you want to emphasize the{" "}
          <strong>current state</strong> of the control (e.g., "On", "Off").
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          We recommend changing the default label position{" "}
          <strong>only when the component's use case justifies it</strong>, and as long as the meaning and state of the
          switch remain clear to the user.

                Use when the user must select <strong>only one option</strong> from a list of predefined, mutually

        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use for binary, opposing states:</strong> switches are ideal when users need to turn a setting{" "}
          <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong>, such as enabling notifications or dark mode. Avoid using switches
          for choices that are not immediately clear opposites (use radio buttons instead).
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Trigger immediate changes:</strong> switches should take effect <strong>immediately</strong> without
          requiring form submission. Do not pair switches with a submit button or use them for decisions that need
          confirmation.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use clear, descriptive labels:</strong> labels should clarify the effect of toggling the switch. Use
          positive, action-oriented phrasing when possible (e.g., “Enable sound”).
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Stack vertically for better scannability:</strong> when multiple switches are used together, stack
          them vertically to maintain clarity and reduce visual clutter.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Don't overuse switches:</strong> too many toggles on one screen can overwhelm users. Group related
          settings and consider alternatives like grouped checkboxes or forms when appropriate.
