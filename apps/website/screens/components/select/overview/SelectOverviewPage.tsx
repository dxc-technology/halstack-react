      <DxcParagraph>
        The select component allows users to choose from a predefined list of options, making it a valuable input method
        for <strong>collecting user-provided information</strong>. It is particularly useful in forms where users need
        to submit structured data efficiently. Designed to handle <strong>more than four options</strong>, the select
        component improves usability by reducing clutter and keeping the interface clean compared to radio buttons or
        other selection methods. Depending on the use case, it can support both single and multiple selections, enabling
        flexibility in data input.

              Filtering features are present in all variants of the select component, and it's a very useful attribute
              of the component when dealing with long lists of options.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcParagraph>
              As the user types, the list <strong>dynamically narrows down to display only the matching results</strong>
              , improving efficiency and ease of selection. The value updates when the user either types a string that
              matches an existing option or manually selects one from the list. If no matches are found, a "No matches
              found" message is displayed, providing clear feedback.

          <DxcParagraph>
            The select component can be either <strong>optional</strong> or <strong>required</strong>, depending on the
            context. When marked as <strong>optional</strong>, it includes a placeholder-like option that allows users
            to leave the field empty if no selection is needed. On the other hand, if no optional label is present, the
            field is considered <strong>required</strong>, meaning users must choose an option before proceeding. If a
            required select is left empty, an error message stating "<strong>This field cannot be empty</strong>" should
            appear when the component loses focus, ensuring users provide the necessary input before submitting a form.

            <DxcParagraph>
              While both the <strong>select</strong> and <strong>dropdown</strong> components present a list of options,
              they serve distinct purposes within an interface. The <strong>select</strong> component is primarily used
              in forms to collect user input, allowing either single or multiple selections from a predefined set of
              options. It is designed to replace traditional radio buttons or checkboxes when space efficiency is
              needed, especially when dealing with long lists. Additionally, the select component can include a
              filtering mechanism to help users find their desired option more easily.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcParagraph>
              On the other hand, the <strong>dropdown</strong> component is not meant for form inputs but rather for
              displaying contextual actions or navigation links. It typically triggers a menu that offers options such
              as commands, shortcuts, or external links, often enhancing interaction within a UI. Unlike the select,
              dropdowns do not retain selected values within the component itself but instead execute an action upon
              selection.
            </DxcParagraph>
            <DxcParagraph>
              When deciding between the two, consider whether the component needs to collect and retain user input
              (select) or provide quick access to actions and links (dropdown).

            <strong>Select all</strong> and <strong>grouped selection</strong> options provide users with efficient ways
            to manage large sets of checkable items within a list, dropdown, or multi-select component. These options
            help reduce interaction costs and minimize repetitive actions, especially when dealing with categorized data

                  <strong>Grouped selection</strong> enables users to manage selections within categorized sections of a

              The <strong>multiple-selection allows users to choose more than one option</strong> from a list, making it
              perfect for scenarios where multiple selections are necessary. This variant is commonly used in filters,
              permission settings, tag selection, and cases where users need to customize their choices, such as
              selecting multiple product categories, preferred communication channels, or applicable document types.

              To enhance usability, this variant includes a "<strong>Select all</strong>" feature within the listbox,
              allowing users to quickly select all options at once. This functionality is especially useful in forms
              with long lists, where multiple selections are likely to be valid, reducing the time and effort needed to

          <strong>Use select for more than four options:</strong> if the number of choices is fewer, consider using

        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Enable filtering for long lists:</strong> if the option list is extensive (around 15 or more items),
          use the filterable variant to help users quickly find relevant choices.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Label optional fields clearly:</strong> when the select field is optional, ensure a placeholder option
          is available to indicate that the field can be left empty. If it’s required, provide an error message when
          left unselected.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Choose the right selection mode:</strong> use the single-selection variant when users need to pick
          only one option. If multiple selections are needed, enable the multi-selection variant and consider including
          the "select all" feature for better usability.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Keep option labels clear and concise:</strong> avoid overly long or ambiguous option labels. Each
          choice should be easily scannable and self-explanatory.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use placeholders wisely:</strong> a placeholder should provide guidance but not be mistaken for a
          default selection. Be clear and concise when deciding which placeholder to set into the select.
