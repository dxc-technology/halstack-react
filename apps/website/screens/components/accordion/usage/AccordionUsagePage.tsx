          The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the
          accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. Accordions begin by default in the collapsed state with
          all content panels closed. Starting in a collapsed state gives the user a high level overview of the available
          information.
