        Being a <strong>non-clickable UI element</strong>, the status light is used to provide a quick, at-a-glance
        indication of system states, alerts, or conditions within an interface. Designed for clarity and instant
        recognition, it seamlessly integrates into various layouts without adding cognitive load. Status lights follow a
        consistent color-coded system to ensure users can easily interpret their meaning. They are often used alongside
        other components, such as tables, accordions, or dashboards, to enhance visibility and provide contextual
        awareness.

          The status light component is available in five semantic variants, each represented by a distinct color. These
          colors ensure clear communication of different states.

          Additionally, the component comes in three different sizes, allowing for flexibility across various layouts
          and screen sizes while maintaining readability and visual consistency.

          <strong>Ensure semantic accuracy:</strong> always match each status light color with the correct meaning to
          maintain clarity and avoid misinterpretation.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Optimize for different screen sizes:</strong> Select the appropriate size to ensure visibility and
          legibility across various layouts.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use clear and concise labels:</strong> Keep them brief and ensure they accurately describe the current
          state.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Combine with badges carefully:</strong> status lights and semantic badges can only be used together if
          one of them does not use a semantic color or if their semantic colors do not contradict each other. This
          prevents misinterpretation and maintains clarity in data visualizations such as tables, charts, or grids.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use strategically:</strong> overusing status lights in interfaces with high cognitive load can
          overwhelm users and disrupt readability. Use them only where they add real value.
