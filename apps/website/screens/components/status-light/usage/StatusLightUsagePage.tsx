        The Status light component serves as a powerful communicator of an element or process' status. It focuses
        exclusively on conveying semantic information within a range of five variants, each of them aligned with its
        specific process status.
      </DxcParagraph>

              Match each status light variant with the correct semantic meaning to communicate clearly and consistently
              messages about our statuses.

              Use each size of the component according to the different screen sizes where it will be placed, paying
              special attention to maintaining legibility and functionality.

              Use concise and precise labels that reflect the status of a process accordingly. You should not use more
              than three words in a status light label.

              Mix semantic meanings within Status lights, as this will lead to confusion and misinterpretation of
              process states.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Use Status light and semantic badges in the same data visualization format (tables, charts, data
              grids...).

              Overuse the component. In screens with high cognitive load, you should not overuse this component, as it
              may confuse users and interrupt the reading flow.
