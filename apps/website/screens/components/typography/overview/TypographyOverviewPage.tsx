          Our Typography component should be considered a fallback option and used{" "}
          <strong>only when none of the following components meet your specific needs</strong>. Each of these components
          is designed to convey structure and meaning more effectively within an interface:
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcBulletedList>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>
              <Link href="/components/heading" passHref legacyBehavior>
                <DxcLink>Heading</DxcLink>
              </Link>
              :
            </strong>{" "}
            Provides semantic structure and visual hierarchy to content sections, improving both navigation and
            accessibility.

              :
            </strong>{" "}
            Used for blocks of body text, supporting longer-form content while maintaining readability and consistent
            spacing.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <strong>

              </Link>
              :
            </strong>{" "}
            Ideal for presenting items or information in a non-sequential list, helping users quickly scan grouped
            content.

      <DxcBulletedList>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Keep a clear visual hierarchy:</strong> Use different sizes, weights, and styles to organize content.
          This helps users quickly understand the structure and importance of information.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Prioritize readability:</strong> Make sure there is enough contrast between text and background to
          ensure it's easy to read for everyone.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Allow for sufficient white space:</strong> Space between lines, paragraphs, and elements improves
          legibility and creates a more open, scannable layout.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Ensure responsiveness:</strong> Typography should adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions
          without breaking or becoming hard to read.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Avoid overusing all caps:</strong> All-uppercase text is harder to read in longer blocks. Use it
          sparingly for labels or short button text.
