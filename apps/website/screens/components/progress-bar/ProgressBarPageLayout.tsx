            Progress indicators offer visibility of system status to the user, giving feedback to indicate that the
            application is taking some time to processing data. The main aim of these components is to reduce the
            user&#39;s uncertainty about offering something to look at while the user is waiting for the end. A progress
            bar should be used in any scenario that will take more than 1 second in performing the action, for anything
            that takes less than that time, it will be distracting for the user.
