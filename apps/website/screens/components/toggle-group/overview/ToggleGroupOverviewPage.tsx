        The toggle group component provides a flexible way to present <strong>related options or actions</strong> within
        a single interface. It consists of multiple toggle buttons, allowing users to make either single or multiple
        selections depending on the configuration. This component is particularly useful for settings, filtering
        options, or mode switching, where users need to quickly <strong>toggle between states</strong>. By grouping
        these actions together, it enhances usability and keeps the interface organized, ensuring a seamless interaction
        experience.

            The <strong>multiple selection</strong> variant of the toggle group component allows users to select

          <strong>Choose the right selection mode:</strong> use <strong>single selection</strong> when only one option
          can be active at a time (e.g., selecting a payment method). Use <strong>multiple selection</strong> when users
          can activate several options simultaneously (e.g., selecting policy add-ons).
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Group related actions logically:</strong> ensure that the toggle buttons represent actions or choices
          that are related to each other, helping users make clear and informed selections.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Use appropriate labels and icons:</strong> labels should be concise and self-explanatory. If using
          icons, ensure they clearly represent their respective actions or choices.
        </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Stack options based on content needs:</strong> use a <strong>horizontal layout</strong> when there are
          only a few options and space allows, making comparisons easier. Use a <strong>vertical layout</strong> when
          dealing with multiple choices or longer text labels to enhance readability.

        <DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <strong>Be mindful of where you place the toggle group:</strong> this component is not meant to replace{" "}
          <strong>radio buttons</strong>, <strong>checkboxes</strong>, or <strong>switches</strong>, as it does not
          register selections as form inputs. If the user needs to provide structured answers, use the appropriate form
          elements instead.
