          The Flex component is designed to provide a more efficient way to organize, align, and distribute space among
          items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic (hence the term 'flex').
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          By leveraging the capabilities of the Flex component, developers can create more flexible and responsive
          layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and device types. This powerful tool enables the creation of
          complex structures that can be easily adjusted to accommodate various content types and user interactions.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          In the sections that follow, we'll explore the core concepts and best practices for using the Flex component.
          By understanding these principles, you can optimize the layout of your application, enhance the user experience,
          and create more engaging and visually appealing interfaces.

        <DxcParagraph>
          Flexboxes are comprised mainly of two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the
          flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcBulletedList>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values: <Code>row</Code>,{" "}
            <Code>row-reverse</Code>, <Code>column</Code> and <Code>column-reverse</Code>.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.
            <DxcBulletedList type="circle">
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                If the flex-direction (main axis) is set to <Code>row</Code> or <Code>row-reverse</Code> the cross axis
                runs down the columns.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
              <DxcBulletedList.Item>
                If the flex-direction is set to <Code>column</Code> or <Code>column-reverse</Code>, the cross axis runs
                down the rows.
              </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            </DxcBulletedList>
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
        </DxcBulletedList>

    content: (

        <DxcParagraph>
          The flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. Left to right or right to left can be
          used depending, for example, on the language used. A start and end edge is used to refer to the direction of
          the placement of elements.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          For example, If the flex-direction is row and the language is English, then the start edge of the main axis
          will be on the left, the end edge on the right.
