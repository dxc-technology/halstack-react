              Halstack is the DXC Technology's open source design system for
              insurance products and digital experiences. Our system provides
              all the tools and resources needed to create superior, beautiful
              but above all, functional user experiences.

                The color palette is an essential asset as a communication
                resource of our design system. Halstack color palette brings a
                unified consistency and helps in guiding the user's perception
                order. Our color palette is based in the HSL model . All our
                color families are calculated using the lightness value of the
                standard DXC palette colors. Color Tokens Halstack uses tokens
                to manage color. Appart from a multi-purpose greyscale family,
                purple and blue are the core color families used in our set of
                components. Additional families as red, green and yellow help as
                feedback role-based color palettes and must not be used outside
                this context.

                In the search of consistent alignment between the elements we
                provide a spacing scale based on a root values of 8px and 4px.
                The numbers 4 and 8 are easily multiplied, they provide flexible
                and consistent, yet distinct enough, steps between them.

                Our selected typography helps in structuring our user's
                experience based on the visual impact that it has on the user
                interface content. It defines what is the first noticeable piece
                of information or data based on the font shape, size, color, or
                type and it highlights some pieces of text over the rest. Some
                typographic elements used in Halstack Design System include
                headers, body, taglines, captions, and labels. Make sure you
                include all the different typographic variants in order to
                enhance the application's content structure, including the
                Heading component which defines different levels of page and
                section titles

                In order to understand what a theme is, we need to understand
                first that the definition of colors, sizes, shapes... is an
                intrinsic part of a design system. Since these parameters are
                essential for guaranteeing accessibility and a good user
                experience, having the ability of changing them, might go
                frontally against the intentions of the design system. This is
                precisely what themes are, just custom defined objects that
                allow users to override fundamental decisions of Halstack Design
                System. They are a way of escaping the restrictions imposed by
                the Design System, and using themes could result in applications
                not being compliant with the Halstack guidelines, or even
                introducing many different types of accessibility issues if not
                used carefully. Typically, you would create a Halstack Design
                System application, and after that, only if there is a
                white-labeling requirement, we would apply a theme on top of the
                base application. This, and only this, is the whole purpose of
