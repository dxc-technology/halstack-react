            Icon sizes can vary based on use case and application context. Most
            of the icons that are currently used within Halstack components
            follow a 24x24px size including the background or space around the
            icon. There are a few exceptions where 20x20 or 16x16 icon sizes are
            used as these sizes better match the visual context of the element.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Currently, the default color of icons is always inherited from the
            parent during implemented. If no color is specified, the icon will
            be black by default (with a few cases where the default is purple).
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Icons come in outlined and filled variants. The currently
            implemented icons use base colors of black or white for visual
            consistency.

          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            While there currently exists a library of over three thousand icons,
            there may be instances when a custom icon is needed (such as icons
            that represent brands, companies or organizations), an SVG
            implementation option is also available for use. This use should be
            limited only to these situations as it is highly encouraged to use
            the existing icon set for design consistency.

            Use icons within the context of commonly used components such as
            buttons, links, navigation items or status indicators.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Do not use icons that fill the entire space allotted for the icon.
            All icons currently implemented maintain a minimum of 1px of space
            each side (the largest solid icon occupies a maximum of 22px width
            or height).
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Make sure to maintain scaling proportions and aspect ratios when
            resizing icons.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            When using colors, make sure to consider the context of the icon
            being used as well as the consistency of visual information being
            presented.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Limit the usage of colors green, red, and blue to common
            notifications such as success, error, or information.
          </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          <DxcBulletedList.Item>
            Halstack Users are encouraged to share their own variations of icon
            usage with the Halstack team so that these can be added as
            references.
