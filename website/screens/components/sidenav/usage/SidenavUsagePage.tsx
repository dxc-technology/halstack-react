          The responsive version of the component for mobile and tablet works a
          little bit different compared with the version for desktop. As the
          size of the screen in those devices is reduced, the default behavior
          in the first load of the page will be hidden in the sidenav component.
          Taking this approach, as a first view of the page the user has all the
          content in the main area visible, and then he will need to interact
          with the component to make it visible and navigate to other resources.
        </DxcText>
        <DxcText as="p">
          Also, as an important point to mention, the only variant that works
          with responsive is the overlay, due to lack of space in the screen if
          the sidenav pushed the content of the main container.
