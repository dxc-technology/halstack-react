        The Status light component serves as a powerful communicator of an
        element or process' status. It focuses exclusively on conveying semantic
        information within a range of five variants, each of them aligned with
        its specific process status.

              Match each status light variant with the correct semantic meaning
              to communicate clearly and consistently messages about our
              statuses.

              Use each size of the component according to the different screen
              sizes where it will be placed, paying special attention to
              maintaining legibility and functionality.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Use concise and precise labels that reflect the status of a
              process accordingly. You should not use more than three words in a
              status light label.

              Mix semantic meanings within Status lights, as this will lead to
              confusion and misinterpretation of process states.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Use Status light and semantic badges in the same data
              visualization format (tables, charts, data grids...).

              Overuse the component. In screens with high cognitive load, you
              should not overuse this component, as it may confuse users and
              interrupt the reading flow.
