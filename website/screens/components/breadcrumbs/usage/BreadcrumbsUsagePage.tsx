        Breadcrumbs are a navigational component used in user interfaces to
        improve the user experience by providing a clear path to previous steps
        or navigational levels. They typically display the user's current
        location within the hierarchical structure of an application, allowing
        for easy navigation and improved orientation.

              Use breadcrumbs when there are more than two navigational levels
              within the same hierarchy to help users easily navigate and
              understand their position.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Ensure each label of the Breadcrumbs items is informative yet
              brief, providing users with a clear understanding of where each
              link will take them without overwhelming them with too much text.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Always position breadcrumbs in the top left corner of the
              interface.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          </DxcBulletedList>

              Avoid overloading the component. Including too many items in the
              breadcrumbs increases the cognitive load of the interface and can
              confuse users. We recommend using the collapsed version of the
              component when there are more than four items.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Don't use breadcrumbs to replace primary navigation or links, as
              they are intended to serve as a supplementary navigation aid.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
            <DxcBulletedList.Item>
              Refrain from using breadcrumbs to represent the sequence of steps
              to complete an action. Remember that it is a navigation component
              through levels with an established hierarchy.
            </DxcBulletedList.Item>
          </DxcBulletedList>

        <DxcParagraph>
          When there are more than four items in the breadcrumbs, the component
          will collapse the items in a dropdown menu to avoid overloading the
          interface. Users can click on the dropdown to view the hidden items
          and navigate to the desired level.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <DxcParagraph>
          Although this can be configurable, we highly encourage our users to
          stick with the collapsing at five or more items. This was not a random
          decision, we carefully selected it to ensure the component does not
          overload the interface and remains an effective navigational aid.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <Example example={collapsed} />
        <DxcParagraph>
          Depending on the amount of available space, the collapsed breadcrumbs
          can be synthesized more by removing the root element and displaying
          only the collapsed dropdown and the current page.
        </DxcParagraph>
        <Example example={noRoot} />
        <DxcParagraph>
          Be mindful of your user's cognitive load and collapse breadcrumbs
          appropriately.
